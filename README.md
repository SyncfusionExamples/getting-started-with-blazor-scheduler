# How to Add a Blazor Scheduler to the Blazor Server App?

The [Blazor Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-scheduler?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-scheduler-github-samples) is a fully-featured event calendar component that helps users manage their time efficiently with features similar to those of the Outlook calendar. This quick-start Blazor server app project will help you to learn how to configure and add the Blazor Scheduler to it. You will also learn how to bind a list of appointment data to the Scheduler data source and bind data from a remote service URL.

## Features and Benefits

### Different view modes
The Blazor Scheduler offers a wide variety of view modes: day, week, workweek, month, agenda, month-agenda, and timeline. It allows you to easily configure each view with different, view-specific options. You can also display multiple days, weeks, and months by extending each view mode based on the interval count.

### Data binding
Data binds seamlessly with various [local and remote data sources](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/scheduler/data-binding?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-scheduler-github-samples): JSON, RESTful services, OData services, and WCF services.

### Event handling 
There is built-in support for better [event handling](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-scheduler/scheduler-events?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-scheduler-github-samples), such as easier appointment creation and editing using the default event editor or through intuitive drag-and-resize actions. Configure recurring events to repeat on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. Change the look and feel of events by customizing their default appearance using templates.

### Drag and drop events
Reschedule appointments easily by dragging them onto the required time slots. You can also see the live time updates on the dragged appointments.

### Event resizing
Extend a Scheduler event’s time by resizing either its start or end handlers. You can also see the live time updates on the resized appointments.

### Resource grouping
Assign resources to events and schedule them. Group appointments based on resources or dates. [Group resources](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-scheduler/multiple-resources?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-scheduler-github-samples) by date to provide a quick overview of each resource’s availability. You can also set different working days for each resource. A new compact layout for displaying resources on mobile screens brings clear visibility of the events of each resource.

### Timeline scheduling
[Timeline scheduling](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-scheduler/timeline-views?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-scheduler-github-samples) plays a major role in the Blazor Scheduler, as it displays resources in rows in a hierarchical tree-like structure with expand and collapse options. Its feature-rich calendar options, compact resource scheduling, and clear event representation allow you to employ it in various real-time applications. You can also display the year, month, and week number text labels on each header row of timeline views with out-of-the-box templates.

### Responsive and touch-friendly
The Blazor Scheduler has a highly responsive layout and a finely optimized design for desktops, touch screens, and smart phones. 

### Customizable UI
The Blazor Scheduler inherits almost all the calendar-specific features, such as the first day of the week and timescale. You can customize the appearance of any part of the Scheduler interface using HTML and CSS.

### User-friendly interactions
The modern and trendy UI design of the Blazor Scheduler makes user interactions simpler and more efficient. It includes a quick overview of event information, smooth date navigation, view navigation, and easier selection of cells and events.

### Real-time data synchronization
The real-time appointment data of Outlook and Google Calendar accurately synchronizes with our Blazor Scheduler. Scheduler also supports bidirectional data communication through SignalR.
